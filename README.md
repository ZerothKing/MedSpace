# MedSpace : The Online Pharmacy

MedSpace is an E Commerce platform for users to purchase medicines, medical equipment and other related products for a discounted price. We hope that this can make pharmaceuticals accessible to a large demographic of users which do not have access to any other sources to purchase them. The convenience of home delivery will be especially useful as we still have significant risks of leaving our homes during the ongoing pandemic.
